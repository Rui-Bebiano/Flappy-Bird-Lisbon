# Flappy-Bird-Lisbon
A "Lisbon style" version of the popular Flappy Bird game, made with the help of the ChatGPT code interpreter and prompt engineering.

This is a personal project, which main motivation was to explore and showcase the capabilities of prompt engineering as a programming tool. The code was generated by means of iteratively prompting the code interpreter in order to first define the overall game loop and assets and then refine the game parameters and functionality. Several game parameters anmd variables were defined by myself, in a different way from the original game.

This project uses sprites from [samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets](https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets.git) by Samuel Custodio, which are licensed under the MIT license.
